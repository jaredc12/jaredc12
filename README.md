My name is Jared, and I am a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity.

With 17 years of service in the United States Army, I bring discipline and dedication to my pursuits. In my personal time, I enjoy creating memories with my family, traveling, visiting theme parks, reading, attending concerts, and embracing the outdoors.
